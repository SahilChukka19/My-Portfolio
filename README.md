A premium, performance-first engineering portfolio inspired by the precision and telemetry of Formula 1 race dashboards. This platform serves as a technical showcase for AI, ML, and Data Science projects, featuring complex layout-id transitions and immersive game-like interactions.

## 🚀 Engineering Highlights

### 📊 Mission Control Dashboard
The core navigation system uses **Framer Motion's `layoutId`** for shared element transitions, creating a seamless "Grid-to-Dashboard" expansion effect. This mirrors the feeling of opening a detailed telemetry window from a high-level race overview.

### 🧬 Enterprise Case Studies
Unlike standard portfolios, every project is presented through a structured 8-point technical deep dive:
- **Problem Statement** & **Core Objective**
- **System Architecture** (Frontend, Backend, ML Layers)
- **Technical Approach** & **Methodology**
- **Results**, **Impact**, and **Future Roadmap**

### 🎮 Gamified Experience
- **Interactive Tech Lab**: A custom-built hardware inventory system where skills are treated as "performance components" (Engines, Aerodynamics, Telemetry).
- **Milestone Podium**: A staggered 3D-podium layout for accomplishments with holographic "Verification" links for certifications and publications.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend Core**: React 18 (Functional Components, Hooks)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion (Orchestrating complex shared element transitions)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Sophisticated glassmorphism and F1-telemetry design system)
- **Iconography**: Lucide React (100+ technical icons)
- **Build Tool**: Vite (Lightning fast HMR and optimized production bundling)
- **Deployment**: Configured for Vercel/Netlify with optimized asset loading
